# react-job-listing
A simple react web app that shows Job listing with CRUD functionalities that I made following a Youtube tutorial while learning react. Has states, props, hooks, routing and forms. Also has a local database named jobs.json that can be used for running this. No Production build.

downlaod this then do:
npm run dev
open new terminal and do:
npm run server

the local server will be running on port 8000.
